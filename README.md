##Project Abstract 

This project redesigns the LOCUS Academics section, particularly the course registration features. The LOCUS interface is cluttered, lacking in cohesion, difficult to navigate, and with a color scheme and organization that make it difficult to use by requiring a heavy cognitive load. While it does offer advanced course searching, this functionality is undermined by the confusing interface, excessive number of clicks for each task, and nonfunctional links. It is difficult to navigate due to the lack of cohesion in the interface, the screens that are confusingly named, and the general complexity of its map of locations. It requires a significant amount of cognitive load and does not lend itself well to users developing a good mental model of how to use it. It does not employ design elements such as color or icons that assist users in interpreting the information.
